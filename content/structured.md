Huntington Underwriting Limited operates an underwriting facility for Structured Solutions on behalf of international reinsurer(s) with a minimum financial strength rating of A- (Excellent) by [AM Best](http://www.ambest.com/home/default.aspx).

Structured Solutions are bespoke, non-traditional (re)insurance programmes that help manage the volatility in ‘baskets’ of risks, often over several years, incorporating aggregate limits of liability and rewarding underwriting profitability. Frequent use is made of funds withheld arrangements/premium reserve deposits to help minimise frictional costs and reduce foreign currency exchange risks.

Such structures are suitable as sources of contingent capital, for insurance company surplus relief and in captive risk financing strategies (or as ‘quasi-captives’). They are tailored to the circumstances and objectives of each particular client or cedant.

Distribution may be via traditional (re)insurance Broking channels, but also through captive managers, structured financiers and investment/commercial bankers.

Additional capacity is available, where required, via a consulting agreement with [Hannover Rück SE’s Advanced Solutions Group](https://www.hannover-re.com/247549/global-reinsurance), which is rated AA-/A+ by [S&P/AM Best](https://www.hannover-re.com/199230/ratings).
