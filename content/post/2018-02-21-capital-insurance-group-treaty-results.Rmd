### Treaty Results to Date
This table shows the amount of Premium  versus Paid Claims and Outstanding Loss Reserves by Treaty Year of Account ("YOA").  The figures are as declared in the various Bordereaux at 31 December 2017.  

They are denominated in, or have been converted to their equivalent in, Papua New Guinea Kina.  Current Rates of Exchange have been used where applicable.

The Premiums are Net of Taxes and Estimated Ceding Commission as per the Sliding Scale, based on current Incurred Losses.  They have been allocated to separate Treaty Years of Account by Bordereaux Date, whereas the Paid Claims and Outstanding Loss Reserves are allocated by Policy Inception  Date.

  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped","hover","condensed"), font_size = 14, full_width = F, position = "left")
```

This table shows the Aggregate Premium and Incurred Losses for all three Treaty Years.

```{r,echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
inc %>% summarise(Premium = sum(Premium), Paid = sum(PAID), Outstanding = sum(OUT), Incurred = sum(Incurred)) %>%
  mutate(Ratio = round(Incurred / Premium,2)) %>%
  kable("html", escape = F)%>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped","hover","condensed"), font_size = 14, full_width = F, position = "left")

      ## add_header_above(c(" "=1,"Loss Bordereaux Date"=8))
```

### Largest Individual Incurred Losses
This table shows the largest Individual Incurred Loss Amounts (exceeding PGK 1,000,000 or equivalent) as declared in various Claims Bordereaux at 31 December 2017.

```{r,echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
individual <- as.tibble(Claims_Incurred_Report_31_12_17_AAHE_) %>% 
  filter(Contract != "Machinery Breakdown") %>%
  mutate(YOA = ifelse(Inception >= "2016-10-01" & Inception < "2017-10-01", 
                "2017", 
                ifelse(Inception >= "2014-12-13" & Inception < "2016-01-01",
                       "2015",
                      ifelse(Inception >= "2016-01-01" & Inception < "2016-10-01",
                              "2016", 
                             "NA")))) %>%
  merge(ROE, by = "CURR") %>%
  mutate(EQU = HRE * ROE) %>%
  group_by(YOA, Claim, Client, Inception, DOL) %>%
  summarise(PGK = round(sum(EQU))) %>%
  filter(PGK >= 4e5) %>%
  arrange(desc(PGK)) 
individual%>%
  kable("html")%>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped","hover","condensed"), font_size = 14, full_width = F, position = "left")
 

    ##  add_header_above(c(" "=1,"Movement in Paid Amount since Prior Bordereau"=7," "=1))


```

### Outstanding Loss Reserves
This table shows the largest Outstanding Loss Reserves (exceeding PGK 1,000,000 or equivalent) as declared in various Claims Bordereaux at 31 December 2017.

```{r,echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
claims <- as.tibble(Claims_Incurred_Report_31_12_17_AAHE_) %>% 
  filter(Contract != "Machinery Breakdown") %>%
  mutate(YOA = ifelse(Inception >= "2016-10-01" & Inception < "2017-10-01", 
                "2017", 
                ifelse(Inception >= "2014-12-13" & Inception < "2016-01-01",
                       "2015",
                      ifelse(Inception >= "2016-01-01" & Inception < "2016-10-01",
                              "2016", 
                             "NA")))) %>%
  merge(ROE, by = "CURR") %>%
  mutate(EQU = HRE * ROE) %>%
  group_by(YOA, Claim, Client, Inception, DOL, Status) %>%
  summarise(PGK = round(sum(EQU))) %>%
  filter(Status=="OUT", PGK >= 4e5) %>%
  arrange(desc(PGK)) 
claims%>%
  kable("html")%>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped","hover","condensed"), font_size = 14, full_width = F, position = "left")
 

    ##  add_header_above(c(" "=1,"Movement in Paid Amount since Prior Bordereau"=7," "=1))


```

This box shows the aggregate amount for these four large Outstanding Loss Reserves. 

```{r,echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}    
claims %>% 
  group_by(Status=="OUT") %>%
  summarise(Total_PGK=sum(PGK)) %>%
  dplyr::select(Total_PGK) %>%
  kable("html")%>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped","hover","condensed"), font_size = 14, full_width = F, position = "left")
```
### Conclusion
The ultimate net position of this Treaty remains highly dependent upon the final outcome of these four large Outstanding Loss Reserves, which represent approximately 54% and 88% of the Aggregate Premium and Outstanding Loss Reserves of the Treaty, respectively.
